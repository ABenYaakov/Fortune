“Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if
only I knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible.

It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was
not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and
see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not.”

“When I used to read fairy tales, I fancied that kind of thing never
happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!”

“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a
grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in all my
life!”

“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!”

“Who are you?” said the Caterpillar.
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, Sir, just at present—at least I know
who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.”
“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar, sternly. “Explain
yourself!”
“I ca’n’t explain myself, I’m afraid, Sir,” said Alice, “because I am
not myself, you see.”

“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said, in a
hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”

“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if
only you can find it.”

“And the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or, if you’d
like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise
than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to
them to be otherwise.’”

“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t think—”
“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.

“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone: “so I
ca’n’t take more.”  “You mean you ca’n’t take less,” said the Hatter:
“It’s very easy to take more than nothing.”

“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.
“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so on.”
“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.
“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:
“because they lessen from day to day.”

“Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.”
Everybody looked at Alice.
“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.
“You are,” said the King.
“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.
“Well, I sha’n’t go, at any rate,” said Alice; “besides, that’s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.”
“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.
“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.
