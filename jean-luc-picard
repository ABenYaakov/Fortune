Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather
believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to
cherish every moment, because it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as
important as how we've lived. After all Number One, we're only mortal.

The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives. We work to

If there is one ideal that the Federation holds most dear, it is that all men,
all races can be united.

Buried deep within you, beneath all the years of pain and anger, there is something that
has never been nurtured: the potential to make yourself a better man. And that is what it
is to be human. To make yourself more than you are. Oh, yes — I know you. There was a time
you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.

Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its
continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before!

There can be no justice so long as laws are absolute. Even life itself is an exercise in
exceptions.

The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules; it is a philosophy ... and a very correct
one. History has proven again and again that whenever mankind interferes with a less
developed civilization, no matter how well intentioned that interference may be, the
results are invariably disastrous.

There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders. You
acknowledge their sentience, but ignore their personal liberties and freedom. Order a man
to turn his child over to the state? Not while I'm his captain.

You know, there are some words I've known since I was a schoolboy. "With the first link,
the chain is forged. The first speech censured, the first thought forbidden, the first
freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably." Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie
as wisdom and warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're all damaged.

We think we've come so far. Torture of heretics, burning of witches, is all ancient

Mr. Worf, villains who twirl their moustache are easy to spot. Those who clothe themselves

But she, or someone like her, will always be with us. Waiting for the right climate in

It says a great deal about the mind of Commander Data that, looking at the human race with
all its violence and corruption, willful ignorance, he could still see kindness, the
immense curiosity, and greatness of spirit. And he wanted, more than anything else, to be
part of that, to be part of the human family.
